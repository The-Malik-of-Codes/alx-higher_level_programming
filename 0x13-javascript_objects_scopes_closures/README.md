## Description

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language that supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles. Objects are one of the core data structures in JavaScript, and they are used to model real-world entities and their relationships. This project will explore the concept of objects and how they are used in JavaScript, including how to create, access, and modify properties on objects.

We will also explore the concept of scope in JavaScript, which determines the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions. Scope is determined by the context in which a variable or function is declared, and it can be nested within other scopes. This project will explore how scope works in JavaScript and how it can be used to create modules and encapsulate code.

Finally, we will explore the concept of closures in JavaScript, which are functions that have access to the variables in the surrounding scope. Closures are used to create private variables and to implement functional programming patterns such as higher-order functions and memoization. This project will explore how closures work in JavaScript and how they can be used to create more maintainable and modular code.
