# Python - Everything is object

![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/252/r_208403_QPSN8.jpg)

In this project, I studied object instantiation in Python, delving into variable aliasing and object identifiers, types, and mutability. The project involved a series of quiz-like questions the answers to which I provided in single-line `.txt` files.
